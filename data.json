    "output": "When using a 10-K report for financial analysis, it's important to consider the limitations.

The report may not disclose all material information or risks, as companies have some discretion in their reporting. Therefore, it's essential to complement the 10-K report analysis with other sources, such as quarterly reports, news, and industry research, to form a more comprehensive assessment of a company's financial health."
